# Oracle TCG: Draft Formats Specification

## Overview

This document describes three advanced draft formats for Oracle TCG. Each format provides an alternative to Random, Monochrome, or Custom deck construction, offering varying levels of strategic depth, time commitment, and player interaction.

All three draft formats use modified combo bonuses that position deck strength between Random decks (weakest) and Custom/Monochrome decks (strongest).

## Format Comparison Summary

| Format          | Duration | Complexity | Cards Drafted | Discard | Information Level   | Best For                       |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Solomon 7×7** | 14 min   | Medium     | 49            | 9       | Complete (face-up)  | New drafters, tactical players |
| **Draft 12×8**  | 17 min   | Medium     | 48            | 8       | Partial (face-down) | Casual/regular play            |
| **Draft 1-2-3** | 25 min   | High       | 51            | 11      | Partial (face-down) | Competitive/deep strategy      |

## Combo Bonuses (All Draft Formats)

All three draft formats use the same combo bonus structure, which provides medium-strength bonuses between Random and Monochrome/Custom formats.

### Priority 1: Species Matches (Highest Value)

- **3 of same species**: +12
- **2 of same species + 1 of same Order**: +9
- **2 of same species + 1 of same Color**: +8
- **2 of same species**: +7

### Priority 2: Order Matches (If no species match)

- **3 of same Order**: +6
- **2 of same Order + 1 of same Color**: +5
- **2 of same Order**: +4

### Priority 3: Color Matches (If no species or Order match)

- **3 of same Color**: +4
- **2 of same Color**: +3

**Important**: Only the highest applicable bonus is applied (bonuses don't stack).

### Species Reference

- **Orange**: Human, Hobbit, Orc, Dragon, Aven
- **Red**: Elf, Faun, Goblin, Cyclops, Koatl
- **Indigo**: Dwarf, Centaur, Minotaur, Fairy, Lycan

### Order Reference (The Five Orders of Arcadia)

- **Order A (Dawn Light)**: Human, Elf, Dwarf
- **Order B (Verdant Light)**: Hobbit, Faun, Centaur
- **Order C (Ember Light)**: Orc, Goblin, Minotaur
- **Order D (Eternal Light)**: Dragon, Cyclops, Fairy
- **Order E (Moonlight)**: Aven, Koatl, Lycan

### Rationale for Unified Bonuses

Despite different drafting mechanics, all three formats produce similar deck quality:

- **Solomon 7×7**: Face-up visibility provides control, but 9-card discard limits refinement
- **Draft 1-2-3**: Face-down reduces draft control, but 11-card discard allows high refinement
- **Draft 12×8**: Face-down with moderate discard (8 cards) balances between the two

**Expected Result**: Decks stronger than Random, weaker than Custom (unless extremely lucky), and comparable to Monochrome if player is experienced with drafting.

## Format 1: Solomon Draft 7×7

### Quick Summary

- **Deck Requirement**: 1 full deck (120 cards)
- **Players**: 2
- **Time**: 10-15 minutes
- **Rounds**: 14 drafting rounds
- **Key Mechanic**: Asymmetric pick pattern with face-up cards
- **Strategic Focus**: Card evaluation, reading opponent, denial tactics

### Setup

1. Take one complete 120-card deck
2. Shuffle thoroughly
3. Prepare a clear playing area in the center of the table

### Draft Process (14 Rounds Total)

**Each Round**:

1. Deal 7 cards face-up in the center of the table
2. Determine first picker based on round number (see table below)
3. **First picker**: Selects 2 cards from the 7 available
4. **Second picker**: Selects 3 cards from the 5 remaining
5. **First picker**: Automatically receives the final 2 cards
6. All selected cards go face-down into each player's drafted pool

**Pick Order by Round**:

| Rounds           | First Picker | Cards Taken | Second Picker | Cards Taken | First Picker Gets |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| 1,3,5,7,9,11,13  | Player A     | 2           | Player B      | 3           | Final 2           |
| 2,4,6,8,10,12,14 | Player B     | 2           | Player A      | 3           | Final 2           |

**Result**: Each player drafts 49 cards (alternating 4+3 pattern = 7×7 rounds)

**Math Check**: 14 rounds × 7 cards = 98 cards used from 120-card deck (22 cards remain unused)

### Deck Building Phase

- Each player has 49 drafted cards
- Each player secretly discards 9 cards
- Each player builds a 40-card deck from their remaining 40 cards
- Set aside discarded cards (not used in game)

### Strategy Tips

**When Picking First (2 cards)**:

- Take the 2 strongest cards, OR
- Take 1 strong card + deny opponent a combo piece, OR
- Take 2 cards that combo together

**When Picking Second (3 cards)**:

- Balance taking best cards vs. building combos
- Consider what opponent left you (signals their strategy)
- Hate-draft if opponent's focus is clear

**Throughout Draft**:

- Track opponent's species and color choices
- In early rounds: prioritize high-value standalone cards
- In middle rounds: begin building species/order combos
- In late rounds: complete your combos or deny opponent's

**Example Combos to Watch For**:

- 3 Humans (Order A + Orange): +12 species bonus
- 2 Elves + 1 Dwarf (all Order A): +9 species+order bonus
- 3 Dragons (Order D + Orange): +12 species bonus
- 2 Goblins + 1 Red champion: +8 species+color bonus

**Discard Phase**:

- Remove 9 cards with lowest standalone value AND no combo synergy
- Keep cards that complete 2-3 champion combos
- Maintain a balanced mana curve (costs 0-3)

---

## Format 2: Draft-and-Pass 12×8

### Quick Summary

- **Deck Requirement**: 1 full deck (120 cards)
- **Players**: 2
- **Time**: 15-18 minutes
- **Rounds**: 6 pile selections with pick-and-pass
- **Key Mechanic**: Pile selection from shared pool, then Rochester-style passing
- **Strategic Focus**: Combo building, card evaluation, adaptation

### Setup

1. Take one complete 120-card deck
2. Shuffle thoroughly
3. Deal 12 piles of 8 cards face-down
4. Arrange all 12 piles in the center of the table (accessible to both players)

### Draft Process (6 Rounds Total)

**Each Round Consists of Two Phases**:

#### Phase 1: Pile Selection

1. Determine first picker for this round (alternate each round)
2. First player chooses 1 pile from remaining piles in center
3. Second player chooses 1 pile from remaining piles in center
4. Both players pick up their chosen pile (do not look yet)

#### Phase 2: Pick-and-Pass (8 Iterations)

1. Both players look at their 8 cards privately
2. Both players simultaneously pick 1 card
3. Both players place picked card face-down in their drafted pool
4. Both players pass remaining 7 cards face-down to opponent
5. Both players look at the 7 received cards
6. Both players pick 1 card from the 7
7. Pass remaining 6 cards
8. Continue until all 8 cards from the pile are distributed

**First Picker Schedule**:

- Round 1: Player A picks first
- Round 2: Player B picks first
- Round 3: Player A picks first
- Round 4: Player B picks first
- Round 5: Player A picks first
- Round 6: Player B picks first

*Each player gets first pick 3 times for balance.*

**Result**: Each player drafts 48 cards (6 piles × 8 cards)

**Math Check**: 12 piles × 8 cards = 96 cards used from 120-card deck (24 cards remain unused)

### Deck Building Phase

- Each player has 48 drafted cards
- Each player secretly discards 8 cards
- Each player builds a 40-card deck from their remaining 40 cards
- Set aside discarded cards as sideboard

### Strategy Tips

**Pile Selection**:

- Since piles are face-down and shuffled, all choices are technically equal
- However, observe which piles opponent avoids (may signal preference)
- In late rounds (5-6), fewer options remain

**Pick-and-Pass Within Piles**:

- **First pick** (8 cards available): Take highest standalone value OR best combo starter
- **Second pick** (7 cards): Balance power with combo potential
- **Middle picks** (4-5 cards): Prioritize combo completers
- **Late picks** (2-3 cards): Take best remaining or hate-draft

**Overall Strategy**:

- Early piles (1-2): Draft strong standalone champions
- Middle piles (3-4): Look for combo synergies with your drafted pool
- Late piles (5-6): Complete your combos or fill gaps

**Example Strategic Thinking**:

- If you draft 2 Orcs early, prioritize Minotaurs (Order C) or Orange champions
- If you have 1 Dragon, 1 Cyclops, look for Fairies to complete Order D
- Track what colors you're passing to predict opponent's focus

**Discard Phase**:

- Remove 8 cards with lowest value that don't complete combos
- Keep multiple 2-3 card combos over scattered singles
- Ensure you have 12-15 champions you can afford to play (cost curve)

**Note**: This format is statistically equivalent to dealing 6 piles to each player separately, but the shared pool creates more engaging gameplay and player interaction.

## Format 3: Draft-and-Pass (1-2-3)

### Quick Summary

- **Deck Requirement**: 2 full decks (240 cards total)
- **Players**: 2
- **Time**: 24-25 minutes
- **Rounds**: 17 drafting rounds
- **Key Mechanic**: Rochester-style draft with 1-2-3 pick pattern
- **Strategic Focus**: Deep planning, reading opponent signals, maximizing combos

### Setup

1. Take two complete 120-card decks
2. Shuffle all 240 cards together into one large deck
3. Prepare space for each player's drafted pool (face-down)

### Draft Process (17 Rounds Total)

**Each Round Follows This Pattern**:

#### Step 1: Deal Phase

- Deal 6 cards face-down to each player

#### Step 2: First Pick (Choose from 6 cards)

- Both players look at their 6 cards privately
- Both players simultaneously choose 1 card
- Place chosen card face-down in your drafted pool
- Pass remaining 5 cards face-down to opponent

#### Step 3: Second Pick (Choose from 5 cards)

- Both players look at the 5 cards received from opponent
- Both players simultaneously choose 1 card
- Place chosen card in your drafted pool
- Pass remaining 4 cards face-down to opponent

#### Step 4: Third Pick (Choose from 4 cards)

- Both players look at the 4 cards received from opponent
- Both players simultaneously choose 1 card
- Place chosen card in your drafted pool
- **Discard the remaining 3 cards** (removed from game, not to discard pile)

**Result**: After 17 rounds, each player has drafted 51 cards (17 rounds × 3 picks)

**Math Check**: 17 rounds × 12 cards dealt = 204 cards used from 240-card pool (36 cards remain unused)

### Deck Building Phase

- Each player has 51 drafted cards
- Each player secretly discards 11 cards
- Each player builds a 40-card deck from their remaining 40 cards
- Set aside discarded cards as sideboard

### Strategy Tips

**Early Rounds (1-6)**:

- **First pick**: Take highest standalone value or flexible combo starters
- **Second pick**: Look for cards that combo with your first pick
- **Third pick**: Take best remaining or start hate-drafting
- Don't commit too hard to one strategy yet

**Middle Rounds (7-12)**:

- **First pick**: Prioritize combo completers (e.g., 2nd or 3rd of same species)
- **Second pick**: Balance combo building with card quality
- **Third pick**: Hate-draft opponent's obvious needs
- Begin forming your core deck strategy

**Late Rounds (13-17)**:

- **First pick**: Complete your 3-card combos if possible
- **Second pick**: Fill gaps in your mana curve
- **Third pick**: Deny opponent critical combo pieces
- Focus on finalizing your deck synergies

**Information Game**:

- Track what you've passed to predict opponent's possible picks
- If opponent passes you weak cards, they likely took something powerful
- Identify opponent's color/species focus and deny those cards when possible

**Example Strategic Decisions**:

- Round 1: You see 2 Humans, 1 Elf, 1 Hobbit, 1 Dragon, 1 Draw card
  - Strong pick: Human (Order A + Orange, common species)
  - Alternative: Dragon (powerful, but less common)
- Round 8: You have 2 Centaurs already
  - Look for: 3rd Centaur (+12), or Hobbit/Faun (Order B, +9/+5)
- Round 15: Opponent has been taking Red champions
  - Consider: Hate-draft any Elves/Goblins even if they don't fit your deck

**Deck Building Phase**:

- Cut 11 worst cards: low power AND no combo synergy
- Prioritize multiple 2-3 card combos over scattered singles
- Keep 40 best cards with maximum combo potential
- Maintain balanced mana curve (you need to afford your champions)

### Advanced Concepts

**Signaling**: In early rounds, the cards you pass can "signal" which colors/species you're NOT focusing on. Experienced players can use this to communicate or deceive.

**Hate-Drafting**: Taking a card your opponent needs, even if it doesn't fit your deck. Most effective in picks 2-3 when you've seen what opponent might want.

**Pivot Strategy**: If your initial plan isn't working (not enough cards of your species), be willing to switch focus mid-draft.

## Implementation Notes for Software/AI

### Deck Type Enumeration

```c
typedef enum {
    DECK_RANDOM = 0,
    DECK_MONOCHROME = 1,
    DECK_CUSTOM = 2,
    DECK_SOLOMON = 3,
    DECK_DRAFT_12X8 = 4,
    DECK_DRAFT_123 = 5
} DeckType;
```

### Combo Class Grouping

```c
typedef enum {
    COMBO_CLASS_RANDOM = 0,      // Random distribution
    COMBO_CLASS_MONOCHROME = 1,  // Mono + Custom (no color combos)
    COMBO_CLASS_DRAFT = 2        // Solomon, Draft 12×8, Draft 1-2-3
} ComboClass;

ComboClass get_combo_class(DeckType deck_type) {
    switch(deck_type) {
        case DECK_RANDOM: 
            return COMBO_CLASS_RANDOM;
        case DECK_MONOCHROME:
        case DECK_CUSTOM:
            return COMBO_CLASS_MONOCHROME;
        case DECK_SOLOMON:
        case DECK_DRAFT_12X8:
        case DECK_DRAFT_123:
            return COMBO_CLASS_DRAFT;
        default:
            return COMBO_CLASS_RANDOM;
    }
}
```

### Draft Combo Values (Constants)

```c
// Combo bonuses for all draft formats
const int DRAFT_COMBO_SPECIES_3 = 12;
const int DRAFT_COMBO_SPECIES_2_ORDER_1 = 9;
const int DRAFT_COMBO_SPECIES_2_COLOR_1 = 8;
const int DRAFT_COMBO_SPECIES_2 = 7;
const int DRAFT_COMBO_ORDER_3 = 6;
const int DRAFT_COMBO_ORDER_2_COLOR_1 = 5;
const int DRAFT_COMBO_ORDER_2 = 4;
const int DRAFT_COMBO_COLOR_3 = 4;
const int DRAFT_COMBO_COLOR_2 = 3;
```

## Testing and Balancing

### Recommended Testing Approach

**Phase 1: Draft Simulation** (1,000 iterations per format)

- Simulate draft process with AI players
- Analyze drafted pool composition:
  - Species distribution (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Goblin, Dragon, Hobbit, Centaur, Minotaur, Aven, Cyclops, Faun, Fairy, Koatl, Lycan)
  - Order distribution (A through E)
  - Color distribution (Red, Orange, Indigo)
  - Average card power
  - Combo frequency potential

**Phase 2: Deck Building from Pool** (Use pools from Phase 1)

- AI builds optimal 40-card deck from drafted pool
- Analyze final deck composition:
  - Actual species combos included
  - Actual order combos included
  - Actual color combos included
  - Mana curve distribution

**Phase 3: Gameplay Simulation** (10,000 games per format)

- Play games with drafted decks
- Track metrics:
  - Average game length (turns)
  - Win rate by player position (first vs second)
  - Average damage per turn
  - Combo frequency during gameplay
  - Luna expenditure patterns

### Expected Results

Based on combo design philosophy:

| Metric               | Random   | Draft Formats | Monochrome/Custom |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| **Avg Game Length**  | 60 turns | 50-65 turns   | 45-55 turns       |
| **Deck Consistency** | Low      | Medium        | High              |
| **Combo Frequency**  | Medium   | Medium-High   | High              |
| **Skill Impact**     | Low      | High          | Medium            |

### Adjustment Strategy

**If games are too short** (< 45 turns average):

1. Reduce species bonuses by 1-2 points
2. Keep order and color bonuses unchanged
3. Retest with 5,000 additional simulations

**If games are too long** (> 70 turns average):

1. Increase species bonuses by 1-2 points
2. Increase order bonuses by 1 point
3. Keep color bonuses unchanged
4. Retest

**If win rates are imbalanced** (> 55% for first/second player):

- Issue likely not with combos, but with core game rules
- Test with non-draft formats to isolate issue

## AI Strategy Guidelines

### Solomon 7×7 AI

**When Picking First (2 cards)**:

```
Score each card combination:
  - Standalone value of both cards
  - Combo potential with existing pool
  - Denial value (preventing opponent combos)

Select top-scoring pair
```

**When Picking Second (3 cards)**:

```
Score each card combination:
  - Standalone value of three cards
  - Combo completion value
  - Balance between best cards and combo cards

Select top-scoring triple
```

### Draft 12×8 AI

**Pile Selection**:

```
Since piles are face-down and random:
  - All choices are equally valid
  - Can implement "human-like" preferences for engagement
  - Or pure random selection
```

**Pick-and-Pass Within Pile**:

```
For each card in hand:
  score = (standalone_value * weight_standalone) +
          (combo_potential * weight_combo) +
          (flexibility * weight_flexibility)

Weights adjust based on:
  - Pick number (1st through 8th)
  - Round number (1-6)
  - Current pool composition
```

### Draft 1-2-3 AI

**Pick Evaluation**:

```
Early rounds (1-6):
  weight_standalone = 0.5
  weight_combo = 0.3
  weight_flexibility = 0.2

Middle rounds (7-12):
  weight_standalone = 0.3
  weight_combo = 0.5
  weight_flexibility = 0.2

Late rounds (13-17):
  weight_standalone = 0.2
  weight_combo = 0.6
  weight_flexibility = 0.2
```

**Hate-Drafting Consideration**:

```
If pick_number >= 2 AND opponent_combo_obvious:
  consider_hate_draft = true
  hate_value = estimated_value_to_opponent * 0.8

  if hate_value > own_best_card_value:
    take_hate_draft_card
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use Draft format combos with Random/Monochrome decks?

**A**: No. Each deck construction method has its own combo bonuses balanced for that format's power level.

### Q: In Solomon Draft, can I take 3 cards first instead of 2?

**A**: No. The asymmetric 2-3-2 split is core to the format's balance. First picker gets 4 total cards but must give opponent choice of 3 from remaining 5.

### Q: In Draft 12×8, can I look at piles before choosing?

**A**: No. All piles remain face-down until selected. This maintains strategic equality since piles are randomly shuffled.

### Q: In Draft 1-2-3, do I have to draft all 17 rounds?

**A**: Yes. The format is designed for 51 cards, which allows optimal deck building down to 40. Fewer rounds would create too-random pools.

### Q: Can I use leftover cards as a sideboard?

**A**: The rules don't include sideboarding between games. However, you could house-rule best-of-3 matches where players can swap cards between games using their discarded pool.

### Q: What if we want to draft with 3-4 players?

**A**: These formats are specifically balanced for 2 players. Multiplayer drafting would require significant rule modifications and rebalancing.

### Q: Which format is closest to Magic: The Gathering draft?

**A**: 

- **Rochester Draft** = Draft 1-2-3 (pick from hand, pass to opponent)
- **Winchester Draft** = Draft 12×8 (piles, pick-and-pass)
- **Solomon Draft** = Solomon 7×7 (unique to this game, similar to splitting piles)

---

## Changelog and Version History

**Version 1.0** (Current)

- Initial specification of three draft formats
- Solomon 7×7: 14 rounds, 49 cards, face-up (uses 1 deck of 120 cards)
- Draft 12×8: 6 rounds of pile selection, 48 cards, face-down (uses 1 deck of 120 cards)
- Draft 1-2-3: 17 rounds, 51 cards, Rochester-style (uses 2 decks of 120 cards each)
- Unified combo bonuses for all draft formats
- Positioned between Random and Monochrome/Custom in power level

**Design Philosophy**:
All formats produce similar final deck quality despite different mechanics:

- Similar card pool sizes (48-51 cards)
- Similar discard amounts (8-11 cards)
- Different paths to similar destinations
- Each format offers unique strategic experience

---

## Credits and Design Notes

**Format Origins**:

- **Solomon Draft**: Adapted from Magic: The Gathering's Solomon Draft variant
- **Draft 12×8**: Inspired by Winchester Draft from Magic: The Gathering
- **Draft 1-2-3**: Based on Rochester Draft from Magic: The Gathering

**Design Goals**:

1. Create multiple paths to deck construction beyond Random/Custom
2. Reward strategic thinking and format mastery
3. Maintain balance between formats (no single "best" format)
4. Provide options for different time commitments
5. Keep formats accessible with minimal deck requirements

**Balancing Philosophy**:

- Draft decks should be stronger than Random (player has choice)
- Draft decks should be weaker than Custom (limited card pool)
- Draft decks should be comparable to Monochrome (different tradeoffs)
- All three draft formats should produce similar power levels
- Skill should matter more in drafting than in Random deck play
