# Oracle Rating System

A mathematically rigorous player rating system for Oracle: The Champions of Arcadia, based on the Bradley-Terry probability model.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build and run tests
make run

# Or manually:
gcc -o oracle_test oracle_rating.c oracle_rating_test.c -lm
./oracle_test
```

## Features

- ✅ **Intuitive scale**: Rating 1-99, where rating = win probability vs Keeper
- ✅ **Adaptive learning**: Fast convergence for new players, stability for veterans
- ✅ **Two methods**: Incremental (real-time) and batch (historical recalibration)
- ✅ **Automatic rebalancing**: Keeps Keeper at rating 50 (strength 1.0)
- ✅ **CSV persistence**: Easy export/import
- ✅ **Win probability predictions**: Bradley-Terry model

## Basic Usage

```c
#include "oracle_rating.h"

int main(void) {
    // Initialize
    RatingSystem rs;
    rating_init(&rs, NULL);
    
    // Register players
    uint32_t alice = rating_register_player(&rs, "Alice", PLAYER_TYPE_HUMAN);
    
    // Record match (Alice vs Keeper: 12-8)
    MatchResult match = {alice, rs.keeper_id, 12, 8, 0};
    rating_update_match(&rs, &match);
    
    // View results
    rating_print_leaderboard(&rs);
    
    // Save
    rating_export_csv(&rs, "ratings.csv");
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Concepts

### Rating Scale
- **Rating 1**: 1% win rate vs Keeper (very weak)
- **Rating 50**: 50% win rate (equal to Keeper)
- **Rating 99**: 99% win rate (dominant)

### Adaptive Update Multiplier (A)
```
A(games) = 1.08 + 0.22 × exp(-games/150)

- New player (0 games): A = 1.30 (responsive)
- Experienced (500+ games): A = 1.08 (stable)
```

### Update Formula
```
For each game:
  expected = s_player / (s_player + s_opponent)
  actual = 1.0 (win) or 0.0 (loss)
  delta = actual - expected
  
  s_player_new = s_player × A^delta
  s_opponent_new = s_opponent × A^(-delta)
```

### Strength ↔ Rating Conversion
```
s = rating / (100 - rating)
rating = 100 × s / (s + 1)
```

## API Overview

### Core Functions
- `rating_init()` - Initialize system
- `rating_register_player()` - Add player
- `rating_update_match()` - Update after match (incremental)
- `rating_win_probability()` - Predict matchup
- `rating_get_player()` - Query player data

### Batch Processing
- `batch_init()` - Initialize batch data
- `batch_add_match()` - Add historical match
- `rating_batch_compute()` - Compute optimal ratings (gradient ascent)

### Utilities
- `rating_export_csv()` / `rating_import_csv()` - Persistence
- `rating_print_leaderboard()` - Display rankings
- `rating_print_player_details()` - Show player stats

## Testing

The test suite includes:
1. Learning curve (player improvement)
2. Multi-agent comparison
3. Batch vs incremental methods
4. Adaptive A behavior
5. Rating scale verification
6. CSV persistence
7. Keeper rebalancing

```bash
make run
```

Expected output: All tests pass with ✓ marks

## Configuration

Customize via `RatingConfig`:

```c
RatingConfig cfg = {
    .a_max = 1.30,              // Initial update multiplier
    .a_min = 1.08,              // Final update multiplier
    .a_decay_rate = 150.0,      // Games for exponential decay
    .convergence_threshold = 1e-6,  // For gradient ascent
    .max_iterations = 1000,
    .use_draws = true,
    .initial_confidence = 100.0
};

rating_init(&rs, &cfg);
```

## Integration

### Step 1: Add to your project
```bash
cp oracle_rating.{h,c} your_project/
```

### Step 2: Include and initialize
```c
#include "oracle_rating.h"

RatingSystem g_ratings;
rating_init(&g_ratings, NULL);
```

### Step 3: Update after matches
```c
void on_match_complete(GameResult *result) {
    MatchResult mr = {
        .player1_id = result->p1_id,
        .player2_id = result->p2_id,
        .player1_wins = result->p1_score,
        .player2_wins = result->p2_score,
        .draws = 0
    };
    
    rating_update_match(&g_ratings, &mr);
    rating_export_csv(&g_ratings, "ratings.csv");
}
```

## Mathematical Foundation

Based on the **Bradley-Terry model**:
```
P(i beats j) = s_i / (s_i + s_j)
```

Where `s_i` is player i's strength parameter.

**Key innovation**: Fix Keeper at `s = 1.0`, then scale ratings so:
```
rating = 100 × P(beat Keeper)
```

This creates an intuitive interpretation: a rating of 65 means 65% win rate vs Keeper.

## Comparison to Elo

| Feature | Oracle | Elo |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Scale | 1-99 | Arbitrary (1500 typical) |
| Interpretation | Win% vs benchmark | Abstract difference |
| Update | A^delta (multiplicative) | K×delta (additive) |
| Learning rate | Adaptive (decreases) | Fixed K |
| Probability | s/(s+s') | 1/(1+10^(-d/400)) |

**Oracle advantage**: Direct interpretation and adaptive learning.

## Performance

Typical times on modern hardware:
- Single match update: ~5 μs
- Batch compute (100 players, 1000 matches): ~50 ms
- Win probability: <0.5 μs
